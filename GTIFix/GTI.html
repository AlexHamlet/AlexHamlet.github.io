        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>The mission of the Granite Technical Institute is to support students in finding personal purpose, potential and a pathway to their future. This is accomplished by helping students achieve in their program and to move seamlessly to further training
            and employment. Efforts are being made to directly align critical academic subjects with career and technical education courses, thus promoting real-world application to academic theory in such areas as mathematics, science and English. In
            addition, articulation and collaboration with Salt Lake Community College and other post-secondary institutions is being enhanced in order to make the transition to further education easier for students. Clear pathways of training have been
            designed to support student growth from the 9th through the 12th grades. The Department of Career and Technical Education in Granite School District has a well-earned reputation for providing high- quality programs that are targeted at high-demand
            industries. To further this focus, The Granite Technical Institute offers courses in Health Science & Technology, Engineering, Information Technology, Biotechnology/Biomanufacturing, Culinary Arts, Aviation, Agriculture, Cosmetology/Barbering,
            and Home Building/Construction.
